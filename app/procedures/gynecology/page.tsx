  { 
    question: "When should I start getting pap smears?",
    answer: "Pap smears are typically recommended starting at age 21. \
    However, if you've been sexually active, it's essential to get checked \
    for infections earlier."
  },
  { 
    question: "What to do if I miss a birth control pill?",
    answer: "Generally, take the missed pill the next day along with your scheduled pill. \
    If you miss 2 days in a row, take 2 pills for 2 days straight. \
    Your period might occur. Missing more than 2 days increases pregnancy risk; \
    consult your healthcare provider."
  },
  { 
    question: "Do I need to see a doctor if I skip periods?",
    answer: "Yes. Skipped periods could indicate a hormonal imbalance. \
    Consulting a healthcare professional can lead to diagnosis and proper treatment."
  },
  { 
    question: "Are there recommended vitamins or supplements?",
    answer: "Prenatal vitamins, starting from age 13 (when menstruation begins) \
    to 55 (after menopause), can help prevent issues like anemia, common in many women. \
    Choose gluten-free and readily available brands for optimal absorption."
  },
  { 
    question: "Should I be concerned about heavy bleeding?",
    answer: "Yes. Heavy bleeding can sometimes lead to the need for blood transfusions. \
    Proper diagnosis and treatment are crucial. Consult your healthcare provider."
  },
  { 
    question: "How to manage mood swings before periods?",
    answer: "Moodiness and personality changes before periods are common symptoms of \
    Premenstrual Tension Syndrome (PMS). Treatments are available to alleviate these \
    symptoms. Talk to your healthcare provider."
  },
  { 
    question: "How often should I get pap smears?",
    answer: "Pap smears are usually recommended every 2-3 years starting at age 21, \
    if results are normal. However, annual checkups are strongly advised for overall \
    women's health."
